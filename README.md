# Data-Visualization
The importance of data visualization is simple: it helps people see, interact with, and better understand data. Whether simple or complex, the right visualization can bring everyone on the same page, regardless of their level of expertise.

## Geochemical data
The geochemical data can be used to identify and interpret geological processes in igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary rocks. This chapter categorises geochemical data into major element oxides, trace elements, radiogenic isotopes and stable isotopes. The text discusses the main processes which control the chemical composition of planetary bodies, which operate in igneous and metamorphic rocks and at the Earthâ€™s surface and describes the main analytical methods currently in use.
